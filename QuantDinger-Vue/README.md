## Overview

This repository contains the Vue.js frontend source code for QuantDinger. It is the web application layer that connects traders, researchers, and operators to the QuantDinger backend for AI analysis, charting, strategy development, backtesting, execution, billing, and user management.

If you are looking for one-click deployment, Docker Compose, backend APIs, or the full product documentation, start with the main repository:

- [QuantDinger main repository](https://github.com/brokermr810/QuantDinger)

## What This Frontend Delivers

### 1. Research and Analysis Workspace

- AI analysis pages for structured market research and decision support

- Fast analysis, history review, and asset-research experiences connected to backend services
- Polymarket analysis UI for prediction-market research workflows

### 2. Strategy and Indicator Authoring

- Browser-based Python indicator and strategy editing workflows
- Natural-language assisted code generation experiences
- Professional K-line chart integration for signal inspection and strategy validation
- Drawing tools and chart overlays for discretionary and systematic workflows

### 3. Backtesting and Review

- Backtest Center interfaces for running and reviewing backtests
- Equity curves, trade records, result summaries, and configuration review
- Strategy-linked backtesting flows aligned with the backend persistence model
- UI support for iterative research and strategy refinement

### 4. Trading and Portfolio Operations

- Trading assistant pages for the strategy lifecycle
- Quick trade panel for direct execution from signal contexts
- Portfolio monitoring views and virtual position management

- Indicator community and marketplace-oriented interfaces
- Responsive layout, theme switching, and multilingual support

## v3.0.1 Positioning

For `v3.0.1`, this frontend README is aligned with the current product scope and the main repository documentation:

- product messaging is now consistent with the actual QuantDinger deployment model
- frontend capabilities are described as part of a full-stack trading product, not an isolated demo UI
- documentation now matches the recent strategy backtesting productization and the latest public version label

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version |
|-------------|---------|
| Node.js | 16+ recommended |
| npm | 8+ |
| Backend | QuantDinger backend available at `http://localhost:5000` |

### Install and Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brokermr810/QuantDinger-Vue.git
cd QuantDinger-Vue
npm install
npm run serve
```

The development server runs at:

- `http://localhost:8000`

Default login is determined by the backend configuration. In the default Docker experience it is commonly:

```text
quantdinger / 123456
```

### API Proxy

In local development, `/api/*` requests are proxied to the backend through `vue.config.js`.

- Proxy config file: `vue.config.js`
- Default backend target: `http://localhost:5000`

If your backend runs elsewhere, update the proxy target accordingly.

## Recommended Integration Modes

### Option A: Use the Main Repository

For most users, the recommended path is to use the main QuantDinger repository, which includes Docker Compose, backend services, Nginx delivery, and deployment documentation:

- [QuantDinger main repository](https://github.com/brokermr810/QuantDinger)

### Option B: Frontend Source Development

Use this repository directly when you want to:

- customize the web UI
- develop new pages or components
- adjust charting, internationalization, or admin workflows
- build and publish your own frontend artifact against a compatible backend

## Production Build

```bash
npm run build
```

Build output is generated in `dist/`. You can serve it with Nginx or another static file server.

For a production-ready integrated deployment, prefer the delivery model from the main repository, which already provides frontend serving and API proxying.
